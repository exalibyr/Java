According to the supplier, the length of the multiwalled carbon nanotubes is at least 10 um after produc¬tion with CVD, such that the aspect ratio is about 1000 [28]. In a previous processing step this masterbatch was diluted with polypropylene Moplen HF500N (Basell Polyolefins) using a ZSK-30 extruder (Coperion Werner & Pfleiderer) at 200—220 0C in order to get MWNT contents of 2, 3.5, and 5 wt%, which correspond to 1.03,1.80, and 2.57 vol% assuming a MWNT density of 1.75 g/cm [29]. Mixing was performed at a rotational speed of 250 rpm and a throughput of 10 kg/h starting from granular premixtures. After the mixing, the extruded material was granulated. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of cryofrac-tured surfaces prepared from granules of the PP masterbatch and the sample with 2 wt% MWNT are shown in Fig. 1. A XL30 ESEM-FEG (Philips) operating at high vacuum mode was used. DC measurements of volume conductivity at room temper¬ature were performed using a Keithley Electrometer 6517A on plates with a thickness of 0.35 mm.

For removal of mineral additives from the MWCNTs and elimination of their catalytic effect, the samples were treated by the concentrated alkali (NaOH) and acid (HCl) solutions. After that, the samples were filtered and the excess of acid was removed.

The organically modified synthetic fluorine mica (OSFM) used in this study was supplied by CO-OP Chemicals Ltd., Japan, and was synthesized by replacing Na+ in synthetic fluorine mica (SFM) (original thickness of not, vert, similar1 nm and average length of 200–300 nm) of a cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 120 mequiv/100 g with N-(coco alkyl)-N,N-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)]-N-methylammonium cation (see Fig. 1b) by ion exchange reaction.  Synthetic fluorine mica (trade name SOMASIF) used in this study was synthesized by heating a mixture of talc and Na2SiF6 for several hours in an electric furnace. Like montmorillonite (MMT), synthetic fluorine mica also belongs to the same general family of 2:1 layered or phyllosilicates. The only difference between MMT and SFM is that SFM [NaMg2.5(Si4O10)F2] contains ‘F’ groups on its surface [17]. The reason for choosing N-(coco alkyl)-N,N-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)]-N-methylammonium modified synthetic fluorine mica as an OMLS in this study was due to the closest value of solubility parameter of the surfactant with that of PBSA. The solubility parameter (&#948;) for PBSA and organic modifier, N-(coco alkyl)-N,N-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)]-N-methylammonium was roughly calculated from the group contribution methods of Fedors [18] D.W.V. Krevelen, previous termPropertiesnext term of polymer, Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (1990).[18].

Four direct-cooled unbalanced magnetron cathodes (2 Ti, 1 Al and 1 Si) with feed-throughs mounted horizontally in opposed-cathode configuration were used for co-sputtering. The diameter of the sputtering guns was 0.1524 m. In order to deposit TiAlSiN coatings, the substrates were first degreased using acetone, isopropyl alcohol and trichloroethylene. The substrates were finally dried with dry nitrogen. After loading, the vacuum chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 5.0 &#215; 10&#8722;4 Pa. This was followed by argon–hydrogen plasma cleaning under an operating pressure of 1.34 Pa for 45 min at a discharge voltage of &#8722;800 V, which helps to remove the oxide layer effectively from the metallic substrates [12] and [13]. To achieve better adhesion between the coating and the substrate, an interlayer of Ti with a thickness of approximately 0.3 &#956;m was deposited on the substrates. During Ti interlayer deposition, argon flow was maintained at 35 sccm and the voltage was maintained at &#8722;125 V. In order to deposit TiAlSiN coatings, two Ti targets (99.99% purity), an Al target (99.99% purity), and a Si target (99.99% purity) were sputtered in Ar (99.999% purity) and N2 (99.999% purity) plasma at an operating pressure of 5.0 &#215; 10&#8722;1 Pa.

In the TGA curves we can see that the main step of polystyrene degradation is from 300 to 450 °C, attributed to the main chain pyrolysis [17], commencing at about 340 °C with the evolution of aromatics from the degradation of the styrene. We can also see that there are two steps in the degradation of the nanocomposite. The first step from 150 to 400 °C is due to the existence of water in the GO lamellae as well as the degradation of GO. The second step, roughly from 400 to 450 °C, which is the degradation of the polymer, has shifted to a higher temperature range than that of polystyrene. This indicates that there is a strong interaction between the polymer matrix and the graphite layers at the interface, and due to this, mobility of the polymer segments near the interface become suppressed. And we can also see from the TGA curves that at 600 °C, when the residue of polystyrene is almost none, the charred residue of the nanocomposite is 3.8%, deducting the char yield of GO, which is 46.2% at this temperature.

(22, 1, NULL, 'The multilayered films are usually prepared by sequential adsorption of a thick layer of nanocomposite hydrogel or solution followed by slow solvent evaporation. While one spread and dried film already produces multilayers, we use sequential absorption to obtain thicker films simply for better investigation and handling. nother major motivation to use a combined spreading and drying procedure for the nanocomposite films is the ability to obtain well-dispersed and oriented multilayers, which would otherwise be nearly impossible to prepare using conventional methods. Spincasting or dipping of the gum-like hydrogels and solutions was problematic due to their high viscosity and elasticity as well as impurities that were hard to remove. While one single spread film produces multilayers, conventional multilayer fabrication techniques such as layer-by-layer approaches or the Langmuir–Blodgett method would have to add each layer individually. Depending on the concentration, transparent PEO–LRD single films with an average layer thickness of 5 &#956;m–7 &#956;m can be obtained by manually spreading the polymer–clay gel/solution on a glass substrate. Reproducible results are obtained when using and comparing two preparation techniques: (i) a simple spreading device can be used that guarantees the same thickness of each spread layer (but not the same shear rate) and (ii) the films are spread manually with a blade [19]. Manual spreading does not allow for shear rate controlled spreading either. For this work we have chosen only those solutions and gels for film preparation, where the shear rate and exact film thickness are not critical to the final film structure and where the multilayer size and order can be reproduced easily.

All reactions are assumed to be irreversible. In the case of degradation and since the evolved gases are continuously removed by the fluid flow in the TGA chamber, this is a reasonable assumption. It is also assumed that the overall reaction (Eq. (1)) is the sum of individual reaction steps (formal or true step) with constant activation energy, as generally accepted in chemistry. The model can then include competitive, independent and successive reactions. The equations are solved with multivariate kinetic analysis (determination of the parameter via a hybrid regularized Gauss–Newton method or Marquardt method) ', 380, NULL),

The nanoclay was montmorillonite, MMT, trade name Cloisite 20A from Southern Clay, organically modified with a dimethyl-dihydrogenated tallow-ammonium chloride salt and with less than 2% of moisture. The heat stability of the clay was measured by high resolution thermo-gravimetrical analysis, TGA, using a Hi-Res TGA 2950 equipment from TA Instruments, at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, under nitrogen atmosphere.It is known [7] that during mixing of a polymer with powder filler, the higher the polymer viscosity is the higher the stresses and the higher the dispersive mixing. On the other hand, the lower the polymer viscosity is, the higher the distributive mixing is. Thus, it is expected that in order to exfoliate the clay the temperatures should be the lowest, but in order to distribute the clay, the temperatures should be raised. Following this assumption, masterbatches of PEMA and MMT (75/25 wt.%) were produced in a co-rotating twin screw extruder, from Werner & Pfleiderer, model ZSK30, with D = 30 mm and L = 1065 mm. Mixing temperatures between 160 and 230 °C were tested. However, at the lowest temperatures, no extrusion was done because of the extremely high torques developed by the extruder. The optimal temperature range (moderate to low torques) was found to be between 215 and 225 °C, at a screw velocity of 120 rpm, with a mass flow rate of 2.5 kg/h, which resulted in an average residence time of approximately 100 s.

For the samples containing carbon nanotubes, a suspension of chloroform and SWCNTs was initially made (0.068 wt% SWCNT/chloroform) and pulse-sonicated (5 s on, 5 s off) with a cup sonicator for 18 min at 12 W and 20 kHz, and then appropriate amounts were added to the dry copolypeptide powder. A low wattage was used to sonicate the nanotube suspension to avoid SWCNT damage. More chloroform was then added to lower the polymer concentration to 4 wt%. Every polymer solution (with or without SWCNTs) was also pulse-sonicated (5 s on, 5 s off) for 18 min in a cup sonicator (36 W, 20 kHz), followed by 1 hour of sonication in a bath sonicator (70 W, 42 kHz). All solutions were stirred constantly, except when subjected to cup sonication. Low molecular weight surfactants were not used to aid carbon nanotube dispersion due to their tendency to act as plasticizers, which may degrade the physical previous termpropertiesnext term of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, functionalization of the nanotubes was not used since this may damage the sp2 bonding of the nanotubes [26], ultimately diminishing the previous termpropertiesnext term of the copolypeptide composites as well. After the samples were sonicated and stirred, they were cast onto a Teflon® substrate using a film applicator.

Chloroform (CHCl3), ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich.  The MMT ([MxAl4&#8722;xMgx]Si8O20(OH)4, x&#8776;0.67) used in our experiment belongs to a family of phyllosilicates (2:1) that comprises two tetrahedral silica thin layers with a central octahedral sheet of magnesia. Isomorphic substitution within the layers gives intrinsic surface negative charge, and thus dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium (2M2HT) was used as a cation intercalent (95 meq of 2M2HT/100 g of MMT: 20A™ provided by Southern Clay Products), where tallow is predominantly octadecyl chains with small amounts of lower homologues (not, vert, similar65% if C18, not, vert, similar30% of C16 and not, vert, similar5% of C14). The layer thickness is around 1 nm and the lateral dimensions vary from several nanometers to microns.The scaffolds were prepared by a salt leaching/gas foaming method according to the previous report [18].

NH4HCO3/NaCl salt particles sieved in the range of 150–300 &#956;m and 2M2HT–MMT clays were added to the PLA solution and thoroughly mixed. The amount of the 2M2HT–MMT clay was 2.14, 3.58, and 5.79 vol% to PLLA. The paste mixture of polymer/salts/solvent was then cast into a special device equipped with a glass slide as a sheet mold. The cast sheet (approximately 3 mm thick) was obtained after being air-dried under atmospheric pressure for 2 h. After the sheet was semi-solidified, a two-step salt leaching was performed. The sheet was first immersed in 90°C hot water (approximately 10 min) to leach out the NH4HCO3 particles, concomitantly generating gaseous ammonia and carbon dioxide in the polymer matrix. After no gas bubbles were generated, the sheet was subsequently immersed into another beaker containing 60°C water (approximately 30 min) to leach out the remaining NaCl particles, and then freeze dried for 2 days.', 404, NULL),

The PHB production plant is entirely integrated into the sugar mill to obtain an environmentally sound plastic resin [33]: the Ralstonia eutropha  bacterial strains growing and the fermentation steps are made from cane sugar, and the recovery process uses exclusively natural solvents, by-products of ethanolic fermentation. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the polydispersity index (PDI) have been determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Mw = 650,000 and PDI = 2). Melt flow index (MFI) and density are 12 g/10 min and 1.22 g/cm3, respectively.  The quaternary ammonium salts – di(hydrogenated tallow)dimethylammonium chloride (S-Alk), (vegetable oil)benzyldimethylammonium chloride (S-Bz) and oleylbis(2-hydroxyethyl)methylammonium chloride (S-EtOH) in isopropyl alcohol – from Akzo Nobel were kindly supplied by Brenntag Specialities (see Table 1). Tetramethylammonium chloride (TMA) (reagent grade, 97%) was supplied by Sigma–Aldrich and pentadecane (puriss p.a. &#8805;99.8%) by Fluka. Triethylamine 99% pure purchased from Acros Organics was distilled from CaH2.To remove isopropyl alcohol and water from the commercial ammonium solutions, S-Alk and S-Bz were dispersed into diethyl ether, filtered and dried under vacuum in order to obtain white powders. Then, they were added and intimately mixed to the dried PHBp. Regarding the fermentation residues (Rsd) and the S-EtOH surfactant, the pasty nature of these compounds makes homogeneous mixing with the PHBp powder difficult. Thus, they were dispersed into diethyl ether and mixed to the purified PHB. Then, once the solvent was evaporated, the mixture was dried under vacuum. A ternary blend was prepared by adding the S-Alk powder to the binary mixture PHBp + Rsd.  For the thermo-mechanical degradation study, the samples were prepared in an internal mixer Haake Rheocord 9000 at 170 °C. Because of the technical difficulty of obtaining large amounts of purified PHB, this study was performed on samples prepared with the “as-received” raw PHB, i.e., PHB containing 2 wt% of fermentation residues. Different rotation speeds and processing times were tested, ranging from 50 to 150 rpm and from 3 to 15 min, respectively. The torque and the melt temperature were recorded during the processing. The mechanical energy was calculated using Eq.
